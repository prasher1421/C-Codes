# <b>What is a Design Sprint? </b>
### The Design Sprint is a proven methodology for solving problems through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. It is a unique 5 Day process. Design Sprints quickly align teams under a shared vision with clearly defined goals and deliverables. Ultimately, it is a tool for developing a hypothesis, prototyping an idea, and testing it rapidly with as little investment as possible in as real an environment as possible.

### <b> In five days, the Design Sprint will help you to: </b>
- Understand. Map out the problem and pick an important area to focus.
- Ideate. Sketch out competing solutions on paper.
- Decide. Make decisions and turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis.
- Prototype. Hack together a realistic prototype.
- Test. Get feedback from real live users.

### **When to Sprint?**
- Mainly when the challenge itself has a wide enough scope or has powerful benefits.
- When you can see more than one possible/potential solution to same problem.
- Cross functional teams need to enter to collaborate and work together.

### **Preparation:**
- Block out the entire week in you and your team’s calendar.
- No devices are allowed in the room. This is so that the entire team is focussed one hundred percent of the time.
- Stock up on post-it notes. You’ll need these to jot down ideas and map them on a wall.
- Whiteboards and plenty of markers.

## **The 5 Phases are**
1. Understand
2. Ideate
3. Decide
4. Prototyping
5. Test
<br>

## **Understand the Problem**

### **What is the long term goal?**
### At the start of the sprint, you need to set a long term goal. This should serve as your beacon of light to keep everyone moving in the same direction. Once established, it’s important to turn the goal into actionable items by rephrasing your assumptions and obstacles into sprint questions.
### For example, if your long term goal is to “build an army of loyalists through products that deliver reasons to return”; then a sprint question could be “will customers feel motivated to recommend us?”.

### **How Might We turn this problem into an opportunity?**
### The How Might We method is used to turn existing problems into opportunities. For example, if the problem is that “users struggle to know what to buy for their friend as a gift”, then the How Might We could be “how might we help the user better understand what they know about their friend?”.

### **Which problem do we target?**
` ` `
“Who is the most important customer, and what’s the critical moment of that customer’s experience?.”
` ` `
### At the end of the day, the decider needs to select one target customer and one target event on the Customer Journey map to focus on. This will become the focus problem for the rest of the sprint.

## **Ideate the Solutions**
### **Remix and improve with Lightning Demos**
### Lightning demos encourage your team to research competitors and find examples of existing products that could serve as inspiration for your solution. Each person should give a 3 minute demo of their findings.

### **Sketch in four steps**
### The **four-step sketch method** forces you to create solutions in an effective manner whilst iterating on each variation along the way.

1. **Notes.** Start with twenty minutes to take notes of the goal, opportunities and inspiration you’ve collected earlier on.
2. **Ideas.** Spend another twenty minutes drawing out rough ideas to form your thoughts.
3. **Crazy 8s.** Take your strongest solution and sketch out eight different variations of it in eight minutes, known as the ‘Crazy 8s’ exercise.
4. **Solution sketch.** Draw a detailed end to end solution for the problem in the next thirty minutes or more.

## **Make A Decision**
### **Decide on the best solution to prototype**
### The process to reaching consensus on the best solution can be carried out in five steps:
### 1. **Art museum.** Put all the sketches on a wall to create an art gallery. Ideally, the sketches should be anonymous, so the facilitator should assist with hanging them up.
### 2. **Heat map.** Each team member is given three dot stickers to assign to the sketches or parts of the sketches that they find interesting. This is to be done in silence.
### 3. **Speed critique.** Each member selects a drawing that is not their own and quickly walks through the solution, using sticky notes to capture the big ideas.
### 4. **Dot voting.** Each team member is given one vote (one dot sticker) to choose the best solution and justify their decision.
### 5. **Supervote.** The decider makes the final call with three votes (three dot stickers).

### **Create a story board**
### On a whiteboard, draw five to seven frames (and up to no more than fifteen) to start the storyboard. The first frame should contain the opening scene to provide context and familiarity to your users just before they interact with your product. For example, it could be a simple web search, a store shelf, app store or social media site.

<br>

## **Create a Prototype**
### Once you’ve drawn out the storyboard, devote the entire day to building the prototype. The secret to building a prototype is to **fake it**.

### Aim to create a prototype of “Goldilocks quality”. Ideally the quality should be good enough so that it appears real to users but not too much that you spend forever perfecting it. For example, creating mockups using Sketch or Keynote and importing that into a prototyping tool like Invision is an easy way to get software prototypes out quickly.

### To tackle the task, the sprint team should be split up into the following:

- **Makers.** Usually at least 2 designers or engineers responsible for creating the individual components of the prototype.
- **Stitcher.** Either a designer or engineer should be collecting the components from the Makers and combining them into a seamless fashion.
- **Writer.** Usually the product manager should be writing realistic text to ensure that the language makes sense to the user.
- **Asset Collector.** They are responsible for scouring the web and image libraries to provide photos, icons or relevant content to assist the Makers.
- **Interviewer.** They should write the interview script for Friday’s customer interviews .

<br>

## **Test your prototype with users**
### **Test it with users**
### When it comes to user testing, the [Nielsen model](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/) suggests that you only need to interview five users who fit in with your target customer profile. The rationale behind this is that testing more than five users diminishes the value of return since you will already have identified 85% of the problems after listening to five people.
### The questions and tasks that you ask the user to perform during the interview should simulate a real world environment whilst the sprint team watches the recording in a separate room.
### **Learning from feedback**
### Ideally, you should watch the recordings together as a group. Draw a table on a whiteboard divided up into five columns for the five customers and rows for each area or task of the prototype they addressed.
### Look for patterns and themes in the feedback and work towards prioritising these into your backlog as items or features to address in the next iteration of your product.

## **Key takeaways**
- **The user is king.** The entire design sprint process is user-centred. It builds products and services based on a solid understanding of the user’s wants and needs and asks for feedback and validation directly from them towards the end of the sprint.
- **Considers all perspectives.** Design Sprints gather all important people in one place. This means that there’s less of a bureaucracy and siloed structure in the organisation because the process facilitates cross-team collaboration.
- **It’s efficient and effective.** A sprint cuts out all inefficiencies and ineffective discussions. No more dreadful back-to-back meetings that take up your entire day leaving you with little time to get anything done. A five day sprint forces you and your team to focus and work towards something realistic by the end of the week.
- **Manages your stakeholder expectations.** There is clear visibility and alignment from everyone on Day 1. Getting your stakeholders’ buy-in early on and throughout the sprint discussions builds trust and respect between all parties.
- **Learn fast, fail fast.** The sprint helps to obtain a clear vision of the goals upfront. It forces you to make critical decisions and solve complex problems fast. This means that you and your team can save months of design, engineering and development costs. The bonus? You’ll be able to get your product to market faster because you focussed on the right thing.
